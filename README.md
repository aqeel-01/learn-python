# Python Concepts Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of Python programming concepts, covering fundamental and advanced topics, from basic variables and data structures to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and file I/O. The content is organized in a structured way to help you progressively learn Python in a clear and organized manner.

## üìö Concepts Covered:

The following topics are included in this repository, each with practical examples, visualizations, and code explanations:

1. **Variables**  
   An introduction to how variables are used in Python to store data. Concepts like variable assignment, data types, and scope are covered.

2. **Lists**  
   Learn about Python's versatile list data structure, including list creation, indexing, slicing, and methods like `append()`, `remove()`, and more.

3. **Tuples**  
   A guide to Python tuples, immutable sequences of data. Topics include tuple creation, packing, unpacking, and the differences between lists and tuples.

4. **Sets**  
   Learn the properties of sets, including their uniqueness and how to perform common set operations (union, intersection, difference).

5. **Dictionaries**  
   Explore Python dictionaries, which store key-value pairs. Learn how to create, access, and modify dictionary entries, and understand dictionary methods.

6. **Functions**  
   A detailed look at functions in Python, including how to define functions, pass arguments, return values, and use lambda functions.

7. **Loops**  
   Learn how to iterate over sequences with Python‚Äôs `for` and `while` loops. Understand how to use loops effectively with control flow statements like `break` and `continue`.

8. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
   A comprehensive introduction to OOP in Python. Understand classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and how to model real-world entities.

9. **File I/O Operations**  
   Master reading from and writing to files in Python, including file handling techniques, context managers (`with` statement), and file modes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How This Repository Was Created

This repository was developed while learning Python programming from the tutorials and content shared by **Apna College** and the **1-hour Python Video video** by **Mosh**. The tutorials helped guide me through these fundamental concepts, which I then implemented and documented here with practical examples.

You can access the content from both sources here:
